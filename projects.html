        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Database schema evolution is a crucial challenge in the development of data-intensive use applications. Through the lifecycle of software applications, the database schemas have to be changed to satisfy new requirements or improve aspects such as data quality or data access performance. Whenever schemas are changed, stored data and the code of applications must co-evolve to adapt to the new schema. Since the earliest database systems, industrial and academic communities have been devoting a great effort to tackle the database evolution problem, and a number of tools have been created to manage schema changes, which range from workbenches of DBMS vendors to research prototypes. In the early years of the last decade, a new kind of tools emerged as agile practices became widely adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications consist of code and databases, and agile practices must also be applied on databases, not only on the code. Therefore, agile database development (ADD) practices have attracted great interest to manage schema changes, namely continuous integration, automated testing, and the usage of static code analyzers to check code errors. In fact, tools supporting version control of databases and data migration are available since the beginning of the last decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although relational systems are still predominant, the adoption of NoSQL stores is growing, as shown in the popularity rankings and market research studies. There are four main NoSQL data model paradigms (document, columnar, graph, and key-value), and each of them is convenient to overcome limitations of relational systems in some kind of application. However, there are currently no tools that support ADD practices available for NoSQL stores. Another significant limitation of most existing tools to manage schema changes is the lack of mechanisms aimed to assist developers in upgrading the code (queries). To our knowledge, only the PRISM++ tool offers support to rewrite SQL queries. Our research proposal will try to overcome these limitations by building a platform-independent ADD tooling with novelty features such as helping developers in the query migration. It is worth to remark that this topic has not been addressed in the very limited number of papers published on NoSQL schema evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of the project is therefore to build a tooling able to support ADD in the context of relational and non-relational (NoSQL) databases. The created tool should include the following features: (i) to provide capabilities like those currently offered for relational systems as in Liquibase or Flyway to support continuous development practices, but augmented for a wider range of databases, (ii) to help developers to upgrade query-related code by means of code rewriting (when possible) and suggestions, (iii) to apply database refactoring and other optimizations, and (iv) to measure the cost of schema changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work will be based on the results obtained in a previous 3-years project (2018-2020) which received fund from the program to which the present call belongs. A significant result was a generic representation of NoSQL schemas which we will use to achieve a platform-independence tool able to support NoSQL, NewSQL, and relational systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding to the research contributions, we would remark: (i) to extract schema at real-time, (ii) to build a DSL family to manage data and schema; and (iii) to design mechanisms for managing databases in an agile way both at development and production time.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Modern applications (e.g., social media, Internet of Things, and Big Data) have evidenced the limitations of relational systems to meet their scalability and performance demands. This has motivated a continuously growing number of non-relational systems with the purpose of tackling these requirements. “NoSQL” (Not SQL/Not only SQL) is used to denote this new generation of database systems (225 are listed in nosql-database.org). They are commonly classified in four major categories: document, wide column, key-value stores, and graph-based databases. A large number of companies have already embraced NoSQL databases, and adoption will rise considerably in the next years.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the use of NoSQL grows, the need of database tools which provide functionality similar to those available for relational databases is more evident. The building of these tools must tackle the schemaless nature of most of NoSQL databases. While relational systems require the prior definition of the database schema that guides the data organization, most NoSQL databases store data without the need of having a previously defined schema. A recent report (“Insights into NoSQL Modeling”, Dataversity, 2015) has remarked that data modeling will be a crucial activity for NoSQL databases, and has also drawn attention on the need for NoSQL tools that provide three main functionalities: model visualization, code generation, and metadata management. These three kinds of capabilities are better provided with the knowledge of the database schema. Moreover, these tools should alleviate developers from the error-prone task of writing database code when the schema is not declared, but implicit into code and data. Schemaless provide a larger flexibility (e.g. non-uniform data is possible and data evolution is favored), but the advantages of using schemas are lost, e.g. schemas guarantee that data are correctly accessed. Our initial hypothesis is that NoSQL systems will continue growing in the next future, and that their construction will involve a great effort in R&D.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our research group has recently obtained some results in the area of NoSQL Data Engineering, namely a schema inference process for document stores, and we have showed how the inferred schemas are useful to create several utilities. These results have served as a foundation for the 3-years research project here presented. The aim of the project is the design and implementation of an extensible environment and toolset to support the development and management of NoSQL-based applications. The central element of this toolset would be a unified metamodel able to represent schemas (conceptual, logical and physical) of any kind of NoSQL database, ii) metrics for optimizing the data layout and querying, and iii) batch and on-line data migration processes. The environment will support a set of basic functionality, such as: i) visualization and querying of inferred schemas, ii) code generators (e.g., code for Object-Document mappers, REST services and GraphQL), iii) assistants for database design and migration, iv) compute on-line statistics. This functionality will be modularized by the environment, and offered as building blocks of a workflow DSL that will allow users to automate high-level processes over databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research challenges include the definition of a unified metamodel, visualization of large schemas, automation of the database design and migration, and the design of an extensible architecture.
